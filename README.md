# Butler Spyglass

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ptarmiganlabs/butler-spyglass.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Butler Spyglass is a tool for extracting metadata from Qlik Sense applications.
The tool will extract metadata for all applications in a Qlik Sense environment.

## Why extract app metadata

### Data lineage

When using Sense in enterprise environments, there is often a need to understand both what apps use a certain data source, and what data sources are used by a specific app.

* When de-commissioning an old system that feed several Sense apps with data, it is important to know which these apps are. Butler Spyglass provide this information in the form of data lineage information.

* If a data source contains sensitive information, it is important to always have up-to-date information on what apps use the data source in question.

* Reviewing and auditing apps is greatly simplified if there is clear information on what data sources the app in question uses.

### Load scripts

By storing all app load scripts as individual files on disk, it is possible to snapshot these daily and store them in one ZIP archive for each day. This becomes a historical record of what the scripts looked like in the past.  
Traditional disk backups provide a similar capability to bring back old versions, experience has however proven it to be very valuable to have *quick and easy* access to old script versions, for example if apps have become corrupt or if there is a need to revert back to an earlier app version.

Butler Spyglass solves all the scenarios above by extracting both data lineage information as well as full load scripts for all apps.

## What's new

The [change log](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-spyglass/blob/master/changelog.md)  contains the most complete list of changes.

## Extracted data

Extracted information for each app is

1. Load script
2. Data lineage, i.e. what data sources are used by the app in question.

### Extracting load scripts

Whether or not to extract app load scripts is controlled by the configuration parameter ```ButlerSpyglass.script.enableScriptExtract```. Set to true/false as needed.

Each app's load script is extracted and stored in a file in a folder as defined by the ```ButlerSpyglass.script.scriptFolder``` configuration parameter.
Each file will be use the app ID as file name.

### Extracting data lineage

Whether or not to extract data lineage info for apps is controlled by the configuration parameter ```ButlerSpyglass.lineage.enableLineageExtract```. Set to true/false as needed.

Data lineage information is stored in a single CSV (```lineage.csv```) file in a folder defined by the ```ButlerSpyglass.lineage.lineageFolder``` configuration parameter.

## Config file

Make a copy of ```./config/production-template.yaml```, call the new file production.yaml. Edit as needed to match your Qlik Sense Enterprise environment.

The parameters in the config file are described below. 
All parameters must be defined in the config file - run time errors will occur otherwise.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **General** |  |
| logLevel | The level of details in the logs. Possible values are silly, debug, verbose, info, warn, error (in order of decreasing level of detail). Milliseconds |
| extractFrequency | Time between extraction runs. 60000 means that the next extraction run will start 60 seconds after the previous one ends. Milliseconds |
| extractItemInterval | Time between two sets of apps are extracted. The number of apps in a set is defined by concurrentTasks (below). For example, if set to 500 there will be a 0.5 sec delay between sets of apps are sent to the Qlik Sense engine API. Milliseconds |
| extractItemTimeout | Timeout for the call to the engine API. For example, if set to 5000 and no response has been received from the engine API within 5 seconds, an error will be thrown. Milliseconds.   |
| concurrentTasks | Number of apps that will be sent in parallel to the engine API. Use with caution! You can easily affect performance of a Sense environment by setting this parameter too high. Start setting it low, then increase it while at the same time monitoring the realtime performance (mainly CPU) of the target server, to ensure it is not too heavily loaded by the data extraction tasks. |
|  |  |
| **Lineage specific** |  |
| enableLineageExtract | Control whether to extract lineage info or not. true/false |
| lineageFolder | Folder where lineage files should be stored. Files are stored in a subfolder ```lineage``` |
|  |  |
| **Script specific** | Control whether to extract lineage info or not. true/false |
| enableScriptExtract: true |  |
| scriptFolder | Folder where script files should be stored. Files are stored in a subfolder ```script```  |
|  |  |
| **Parameters for connecting to Qlik Sense engine API** |  |
| engineVersion | Version of the Qlik Sense engine running on the target server. Sense February 2019 has version number 12.170.2 |
| server | Fully qualified domain name (=FQDN) of Qlik Sense Enterprise server from which data should be retrieved. |
| serverPort | Should be 4747, unless configured otherwise in the QMC. |
| isSecure | Set to true if https is used to communicate with the engine API. |
| X-Qlik-User | Sense user directory and user to be used when connecting to the engine API. ```UserDirectory=Internal;UserId=sa_repository``` is a system account that will give access to all apps |
| ca | Root certificate, as exported from the QMC |
| cert | Client certificate, as exported from the QMC |
| key | Client certificate key, as exported from the QMC |
| rejectUnauthorized | If set to true, strict checking will be done with respect to ssl certificates etc when connecting to the engine API. |



## Running Butler Spyglass

Once the config file is in place there are several ways to run Butler Spyglass.

## Run from command line

    node index.js

## Run using Docker

Using Docker arguably the easiest way to deploy Butler Spyglass. A few things to keep in mind though:

* The NODE_ENV variable in the ```docker-compose.yml``` file controls what config file will be used. If NODE_ENV is set to *production*, the file ```./config/production.yaml``` will be used.
* The output directories defined in the ```./config/production.yaml``` file must match the volume mapping in the docker-compose.yml file. I.e. if the config file defines the output directories as ```./out/lineage``` ```./myoutdir/script```, the docker-compose file must map the containers /nodeapp/myoutdir to an existing directory on the Docker host:
```./out:/nodeapp/out```.

Looking at the directory structure and the config files, they could look as follows:

*Directory structure*:

    .
    ├── config
    │   ├── certificate
    │   │   ├── client.pem
    │   │   ├── client_key.pem
    │   │   └── root.pem
    │   └── production.yaml
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    └── out
       ├── lineage
       └── script

*config/production.yaml*:

    ---
    ButlerSpyglass:
    # Possible log levels are silly, debug, verbose, info, warn, error
    logLevel: verbose

    # Extract configuration
    extractFrequency: 60000    # milliseconds
    extractItemInterval: 100    # milliseconds

    lineage:
        enableLineageExtract: true
        lineageFolder: ./out/lineage

    script:
        enableScriptExtract: true
        scriptFolder: ./out/script

    configEngine:
        engineVersion: 12.170.2        # Qlik Associative Engine version to use with Enigma.js. ver 12.170.2 works with Feb 2019
        server: sense.ptarmiganlabs.net
        serverPort: 4747
        isSecure: true
        headers:

        ca: /nodeapp/config/certificate/root.pem
        cert: /nodeapp/config/certificate/client.pem
        key: /nodeapp/config/certificate/client_key.pem
        rejectUnauthorized: false

*docker-compose.yml*:

    version: '3.3'
    services:
    butler-spyglass:
        image: ptarmiganlabs/butler-spyglass:1.0.0
        container_name: butler-spyglass
        restart: always
        volumes:
        # Make config file and output directories are accessible outside of container
        - "./config:/nodeapp/config"
        - "./out:/nodeapp/out"
        environment:
        - "NODE_ENV=production"
        logging:
        driver: json-file

## Sample output

With log level set to VERBOSE set in the config file, output might look like this:

## Output files

The data lineage information is saved to a single ```lineage.csv```file:

## Analysing the generated files

There are currently no analysis apps included in the project.
This should be fairly easy to create though. The data lineage CSV file can be loaded into a Sense app and from there be made available for analysis.

The load script .qvs files could be zipped into a daily archive by means of a scheduled task, using the standard OS scheduler.
